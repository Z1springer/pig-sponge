   * ***NOTES TO INTERVIEWER***
   *
   * ---------Answers to clarifying questions----------
   * Q: What should I do if the string is empty or null?
   * A: You do not need to worry about this case. You can assume the input will
   * be a string with at least one letter in it.
   *
   * Q: How should I handle capital letters?
   * A: You can assume the input will not have any capital letters.
   *
   * Q: What should I do with punctuation, numbers, etc.?
   * A: You can assume the input will include only letters and spaces.
   *
   * Q: What should I do if there's extra spaces?
   * A: You can assume there will be exactly one space in between words and no
   * extra spaces at the beginning or end of the string.
   * --------------------------------------------------
   *
   * ---------Hints for struggling candidates----------
   *
   * - If your candidate struggles with an initial algorithm, encourage them
   * to walk through an example and describe how they would do it using only
   * pen and paper.
   *
   * - If they're having trouble determining how to handle multiple words,
   * encourage them to first write code to solve the case where there's only
   * a single word in the string.
   *
   * - If they're having trouble determining how to check if a word starts with
   * a vowel, encourage them to ignore the vowel condition at first, and
   * alter all words.
   *
   * - Remember that Strings should have double quotes and chars should have
   * single quotes
   *
   * - If your candidate is struggling to convert a single word, ask them to do
   * it step by step. Ask them the following questions. If they don't know the
   * Java
   * syntax for it, tell them they can search for it online.
   * - How do you get the first letter of a string?
   * - How do you remove the first letter from a string?
   * - How do you add letters to the end of a string?
   *
   * - If it looks like test cases should be passing but they aren't, double check
   * whether there is an extra space at the end of their output.
   * -------------------------------------------------
   *
   * Extra notes:
   * There are more ways to do this! In particular, using a StringBuilder is much
   * more efficient than
   * repeatedly adding strings together. Learn more about StringBuilder here:
   * https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stringbuilder-class-in-java-with-examples/
   * 
   * There are a lot more comments on this guide than are normally needed. This is
   * just to
   * help you as the interviewer as you are beginning, but in your actual
   * project/work code
   * you should not have so many redundant comments.
